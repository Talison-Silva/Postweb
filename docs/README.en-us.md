## PostWeb - My Baby Project -
[Português (Brasil)](/README.md)

Every developer has their little 'baby project', and this is mine. It was the first project I published on GitHub, marking an important phase in my journey as a programmer. At first, it was just a Node.js course project, and the website's goal was to be a simple blog with basic CRUD actions: create, read, update, and delete posts. And it stayed like that for quite a while — I call this first version legacy, and it's even saved in a private repo. But as I grew as a developer, I decided to build my first 'serious' website, meaning a real production-level project where I could apply all the technologies I had learned up until that point.
